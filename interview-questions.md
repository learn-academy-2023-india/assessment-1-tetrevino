# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. Tip: if you don't know the answer try answering a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Type your initials here to confirm you read the instructions:

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer: A conditional statement is a programming concept where "if" a condition is met, then the computer can logically decide which path to compute

Researched answer: A conditional statement is an operator that lets the computer decide if a piece of code can run, or if it needs to run a different part of code.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: git is a version control software that allows you to iterate different instances of your programs. git is that actual software, GitHub is the host site where you can upload your code into a repository for others to clone

Researched answer: git is a version control system that lets you track changes in your code. GitHub is a web based service for your git repositories.


2. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: The array's index is the numerical position of a given value, where the value is the stored data type at a given index.

Researched answer: An array has an individual element at each index. The index is the numerical value of its position. The value is the actual printed element of the array. 

3. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: strings and arrays are both data types within JavaScript. Strings are primitive, while an array is an object data type. A string can be stored in a variable and is a collection of characters. An array can be stored in a variable, but it is a collection of data types.

Researched answer: An array is an object data type that stores multiple items within a single vairable. A string is a collection of characters, that are stored in a single variable. They differ in that a string is a primitive data type, while an array is a collection of multiple primitive data types. 

4. STRETCH: What are the four pillars of object oriented programming?

Researched answer: The four pillars of object oriented programming are: abstraction (organization.), encapsulation (combine data and code in a single unit.), inheritance (create new classes based on exisiting ones.), and polymorphism (allows different classes to fufill the same behavior). 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms. Hint: use the syllabus!

1. Higher-order Functions: Built-in methods which are a specific subset that takes a function as an argument.

2. Jest: Process of creating automated quality assurance for code. Test framework that ensures correctness of any JS codebase.

3. Objects: Intersection of data and behavior. Objects are a data type with a key:value pair, they containt static information and actions in the form of methods.
